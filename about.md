# About Me

I'm a data analyst transitioning from healthcare operations, bringing hands-on clinical experience into the world of data-driven decision making.

With a background as a Patient Care Technician in surgery and a Dental Assistant, I understand healthcare workflows from the inside. Now I apply that domain knowledge to analytics — using SQL, Python, Tableau, and Excel to uncover insights that improve operations and patient outcomes.

I recently completed the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program, an intensive certificate covering the full analytics workflow: data cleaning, exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, and dashboard design. My portfolio projects use real-world datasets from the CDC, Census Bureau, and open data platforms.

I'm currently based in Kansas City and actively seeking Business Intelligence Analyst roles, particularly in HealthTech and healthcare operations.
